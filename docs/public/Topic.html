        <div class="white-box transparent">
          <p class="white-text">Most costarican history starts at the begining of the spanish conquest as it was named Costa RIca or Rich Coast by chrispher columbus himself in 1503 who discovered the country he would attempt to establish a colony but failed due to disease and unrest from the natives, in 1523 Juan Vasquez de Coronado would be the one to conquer Costa rica adding it to the Capitancy general of Guatemala which was Part of the VIceroyalty of New Spain, After centuries  of living under spanish rule and sensing spain&#x27;s growing instability it all lead to the Mexican war of independance where the central american nations of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica joined the short lived Mexican Empire and succeded in becoming independent in 1821 shortly after in 1823 Costa Rica Would face its First internal Conflict between Imperial Loyalists and Republican forces in the Ochomogo War this Conflict would Result in a Republican victory and a changing of the Capital fron Cartago to San Jose after Costa Rica would Help establish the Short lived Central American Federation, Costa RIca would grow more and more isolationist severing ties with the others until the Fillibusters assumed Power in Nicaragua leading to them to try to invade costa rica they were succesful af first until the second battle of rivas where Juan Santamaria a Drummer in the army set their Stronghold ablaze in exchange for his own life,<br>
            <br> Some years after the filibuster war the Rich americans would once again look towards central america with the establishment of the United Fruit Company an institution that would turn Costa Rica into a Bannana Republic but even still costa rica would remain focused on itself until 1918 when fearing american intervention President Federico Tinoco Declares war on Germany this would not be the first nor the last time the USA would Strongarm Not just costa rica but other Latin american Countries to follow their commands with the Monroe Doctrine, the second time of US Pressure would mark a dark part in Costa Rican History would be in 1941 after a german Uboat sank a United Fruit Company ship killing 24 costaricans and fueling a strong anti german sentiment would rise and with it a declaration of war and internment camps where german costaricans where imprisoned and their land appropriated by the government while not as bad as the american camps this is still a dark part of costa rican history, <br>
            <br>with the end of the Second World War Teodoro Picado&#x27;s presidency would lead to the 48 revolution where a USA Backed Civil war led by Jose Figueres Ferrer toppled Picados Government and ferrer would demilitarize the country to prevent another civil war but others argue that he feard being overthrown himself, while ferrer attempts to modernize costa rica he cant not without appeasing the UFCo whose exploitation of natives and low income Costaricans in coffe and bannana fields made up the majority of the countries exports and was the country's number one employer until anti trust laws in the united states forced it out but the shadow of the Banana Republic Remains. this brings us into the modern age where costa ricas rise begins, costa rica would continue to prosper and it would boom under president Oscar Arias who would win a Nobel Peace Prize but things would start to stagnate until the pandemic where the youngest president in Costa ricas history at 38 years old Carlos Alvarado marks the starting decline of Costa RIca, currently Rodrigo Chaves was elected but with the rise of immigration and Crime he has Attempted to emulate el Salvador&#x27;s President Bucele but failed leading costa rica a country once called the Switzerland of Central America to fall from grace</p>
