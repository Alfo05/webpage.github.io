# webpage.github.io
during the development of the website, i faced many challenges like balancing the work on the website with studying for my other subjects, which i had to take to extraordinary  other challenges i faced were the github aspect because once i finished the code it took me a while to figure out how to connect the different parts together and once i had managed to do that it took me some time for me to figure out how to make the website appear in the pages instead of it only showing the readme file but once i fugred that out i ran into anopther problem regarding github that being that the style sheet and the images did not show up for the pages only the index  but after some trial and error i managed to figure it out 

 I made the practical work about my home country of Costa Rica its history and tourism there is also the about me page the degree page the fundamentals page the contact page and the links to my friends websites there is also the index page which serves as a main menu
